# How to integrate Zymbit with AWS IoT

## Introduction - Perhaps it's own article?
It is impossible to guarantee the successful operation of a remote device
indefinitely. The number of ways a device can be attacked may be infinite.
The highest security standard then must assume remote devices can be penetrated
at any time and plan for their failure.

From this, it is crucial to have the ability to identify and silence
specific devices from a fleet. This requires two parts:
1. Provide a unique identity for each device.
2. Manage the allowed operations of each device.

A unique device ID allows an administrator to specify what device to target.
An ID can be generated by a hash of serial numbers and other unique
device identifiers.

To manage device operations requires a central server to store and index device
certificates, policies and attributes. Luckily, AWS IoT provides these features.

Using AWS IoT also allows device data to be used by other AWS cloud services.
AWS services requires each IoT device must have valid credentials issued by AWS.


## Process Overview

### Global AWS Setup
- Create a private certificate authority
- Register private CA with AWS
- Create an IAM role with GetRole and PassRole permissions
- Create a role trust policy for credentials provider to assume this role
- Create a role alias linked to IAM role
- Create an IoT policy which allows role alias to be assumed with a certificate

### Device Process
- Generate CSR with Zymkey
  - The CSR contains specific device info
- Sign CSR with private CA
- Put device cert and root CA cert onto device
- Register device cert in AWS with root CA cert
- Create a IoT Thing in AWS
- Attach thing to device cert
- Attach policy to device cert
- Curl credential provider url using TLS to receive AWS device credentials

### Create a private certificate authority

**Copy the lines below into a script called mk_ca.sh.**
```
#!/bin/bash
set -e
mkdir CA_files
cd CA_files

openssl ecparam -genkey -name prime256v1 -out zk_ca.key
OPENSSL_CONF=/etc/ssl/openssl.cnf openssl req \
  -x509 -new -SHA256 -nodes -key zk_ca.key \
  -days 3650 -out zk_ca.crt \
  -subj "/C=US/ST=California/L=Santa Barbara/O=Zymkey/CN=zymkey-verify.zymbit.com.dev"

cp zk_ca.crt zk_ca.pem
```
**Then run the script with the following command:**
```
bash mk_ca.sh
```

There are now three file in the directory CA_files.
  1. zk_ca.key
    - The private key for the CA, used for signing CSR's
  2. zk_ca.pem
    - The certificate for the CA in PEM format
  3. zk_ca.crt
    - The certificate for the CA


### Register certificate authority with AWS
1. From the AWS IoT Core console, select Secure, CAs, then Register.
2. Click Register CA.
3. Follow steps 1-3.
4. For step 4 use this command. If you created a CA not using our steps, change
the -CA and -CAkey paths.
```
openssl x509 -req -in verificationCert.csr -CA CA_files/zk_ca.pem -CAkey CA_files/zk_ca.key -CAcreateserial -out verificationCert.crt -days 500 -sha256
```
5. Upload CA_file/zk_ca.pem as the CA certificate.
6. Upload verificationCert.crt as verification certificate.
7. Select Activate CA certificate and Enable auto-registration of device
certificates.
8. Select Register CA certificate.



### Create an IAM role with GetRole and PassRole permissions
1. Go into AWS IAM, create a role with role-pass-permissions.json


### Create a role trust policy for credentials provider to assume this role
### Create a role alias linked to IAM role
### Create an IoT policy which allows role alias to be assumed with a certificate

## Device Process
### Generate CSR with Zymkey
  - The CSR contains specific device info
### Sign CSR with private CA
### Put device cert and root CA cert onto device
### Register device cert in AWS with root CA cert
### Create a IoT Thing in AWS
### Attach thing to device cert
### Attach policy to device cert
### Curl credential provider url using TLS to receive AWS device credentials
